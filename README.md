## Repository Structure

This repository is structured as a monorepo to house multiple distinct Swift projects. All projects reside within the main [`Projects`](https://github.com/dunamismax/Swift/tree/main/Projects) folder. Each individual project folder contains its own documentation with specific details about that application, including features, setup instructions, and architecture.

The general layout is as follows:

```
Swift/
├── Projects/
│   ├── Project A/
│   │   ├── (Source Code, Assets, etc.)
│   │   └── README.md  (Details for Project A)
│   ├── Project B/
│   │   ├── (Source Code, Assets, etc.)
│   │   └── README.md  (Details for Project B)
│   └── ...
├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE
